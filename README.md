# QR-Code-Generator





Generate a full-stack mobile application using Flutter (Dart) for the frontend and Flask (Python) for the backend. The app should act as a personalized AI assistant, allowing users to set goals (routine tracking, fitness, finance, or study) and receive AI-generated suggestions. Instead of OpenAI’s GPT-4, use the Meta Llama 3 (8B) model for free AI responses.

1. Tech Stack:
✅ Frontend: Flutter (Dart) with a chatbot UI (voice & text input).
✅ Backend: Flask (Python) API handling AI queries and user preferences.
✅ AI Model: Llama 3 (Meta AI) hosted locally or on Hugging Face API.
✅ Database: SQLite (local) or Firebase for storing user preferences.
✅ Authentication: Firebase Auth (Google, Email, OTP login).

2. Core Features:
✅ Personalized AI Chat: AI adapts based on user goals (fitness, study, productivity).
✅ Habit & Task Tracking: Sync with Google Calendar for reminders.
✅ Voice & Text Interface: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech support.
✅ Local AI Processing: Runs Llama 3 locally or via Hugging Face API (free tier).
✅ Privacy-Focused: No data sharing, full encryption for user interactions.

3. Backend Implementation:
Load Llama 3 using the transformers library.
Create an API route (/chat) to process user inputs.
Secure user preferences with encryption.
4. Monetization & Deployment:
Freemium model: Free AI with optional premium features.
Cloud Deployment: Host backend on Render.com or Hugging Face Spaces.
Mobile Deployment: Make Play Store & App Store ready.
Ensure modular, well-commented code with a README and API documentation.
