Generate a full-stack mobile application using Flutter (Dart) for the frontend and Flask (Python) for the backend. The app should act as a personalized AI assistant, allowing users to set goals (routine tracking, fitness, finance, or study) and receive AI-generated suggestions. Instead of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4, use the Meta Llama 3 (8B) model for free AI responses.

1. Tech Stack:
‚úÖ Frontend: Flutter (Dart) with a chatbot UI (voice & text input).
‚úÖ Backend: Flask (Python) API handling AI queries and user preferences.
‚úÖ AI Model: Llama 3 (Meta AI) hosted locally or on Hugging Face API.
‚úÖ Database: SQLite (local) or Firebase for storing user preferences.
‚úÖ Authentication: Firebase Auth (Google, Email, OTP login).

2. Core Features:
‚úÖ Personalized AI Chat: AI adapts based on user goals (fitness, study, productivity).
‚úÖ Habit & Task Tracking: Sync with Google Calendar for reminders.
‚úÖ Voice & Text Interface: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech support.
‚úÖ Local AI Processing: Runs Llama 3 locally or via Hugging Face API (free tier).
‚úÖ Privacy-Focused: No data sharing, full encryption for user interactions.

3. Backend Implementation:
Load Llama 3 using the transformers library.
Create an API route (/chat) to process user inputs.
Secure user preferences with encryption.
4. Monetization & Deployment:
Freemium model: Free AI with optional premium features.
Cloud Deployment: Host backend on Render.com or Hugging Face Spaces.
Mobile Deployment: Make Play Store & App Store ready.
Ensure modular, well-commented code with a README and API documentation.




# 20 APRIL 2025 WEBVIEW FLUTTER 

Perfect. Here's a clean, structured series of prompts you can give to Cursor AI step-by-step to create your Median-style Flutter WebView app for free:

üîπ Prompt 1: Create Base Flutter WebView App
Build a Flutter mobile app that uses WebView to open a website (e.g., https://example.com). It should support Android and iOS. Use the webview_flutter package. The WebView should occupy the full screen.

üîπ Prompt 2: Add Custom Splash Screen
Add a custom splash screen to the Flutter app that appears for 3 seconds before the WebView loads. Use an image named splash.png located in the assets/ folder. After the splash screen, transition smoothly to the WebView.

üîπ Prompt 3: Add Progress Bar While WebView Loads
Add a top progress indicator (linear style) that appears while the WebView is loading the webpage. Hide it once the page fully loads. Use the onProgress or onPageStarted / onPageFinished events of webview_flutter.

üîπ Prompt 4: Handle 404 or No Internet Errors
In the WebView, detect if there‚Äôs a 404 error or no internet connection. If so, display a full-screen error page with a retry button and a message like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre offline‚Äù or ‚ÄúPage not found‚Äù. Use NavigationDelegate and check for errors.

üîπ Prompt 5: Make the App Feel Native
Optimize the app to feel more native:

Remove overscroll glow effects

Add pull-to-refresh

Add back navigation when the user presses the Android back button (exit only if there‚Äôs no back history in WebView)

Would you like all these combined into one long prompt? Or do you want to send them to Cursor AI one at a time and build the app iteratively?
